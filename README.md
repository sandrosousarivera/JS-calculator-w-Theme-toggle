# Vanilla JS Calculator. 🍦🧮
This project consist of a calculator with a light and a dark theme.

I programmed this web app in order to practice some SASS, a little bit more JavaScript and the integration between JS, CSS and HTML.

It was the first time I used SASS for the appearance of a web app.


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle. 💡/ 🕶️
- Button color change. 🍭
- Clear button. 🆑




## Tech Stack

- Plain JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- SASS and HTML5.


## Roadmap

In a future iteration of the code I will add a feature that lets the user select its favourite Formula 1 / Soccer team and have the calculator customised with the colors of the selected team.
